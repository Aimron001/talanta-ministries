  <h1>History</h1>
  <p>
    Talanta ministries was founded in 2015 by Rev Joseph Nzavi, Meggy Nzavi and
    other families. They two had served with CITAM for close to two decades as
    pastors in various capacities. They were blessed, released and given cover
    under as CITAM alliance in Machakos where they started the ministry up to
    date.
  </p>
  <p>
    With the support of Citam leadership we started Talanta Ministry at Machakos
    Show Ground in March 2015 . In the course of growth we received an official
    MOU from Citam to be the first ever alliance of Citam in August 2015. We
    value this partnership and with the current leadership we have the support
    to have Talanta ministries registered. We have thus far experienced growth
    having mature members who are part of the ministry not as just members but
    real vision owners.
