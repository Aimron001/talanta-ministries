        <p>Welcome all to the TAMI Youth page. As the youth we have the following activities:
            </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cookouts</li>
            <li>Sleepovers and game nights</li>
            <li>Bonfires</li>
            <li>Prayer walks</li>
            <li>Rise Up</li>
            <li>Plays</li>
            <li>Games</li>
            <li>Debates and discussions</li>
            <li>Concerts, worship experiences and street worship</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Every third Sunday each month, the service is youth-based as we take the church through a time of Praise and worship. Everything from intercessory sessions in the morning to the serving of tea after the service, this is done entirely by us.</p>
        <p>After the service later in the afternoon, we have the “Rise Up”. An entire youth service that&apos;s open to all the youth in Machakos.</p>

        <p>Here we have sessions of praise and worship, debates and discussions on sensitive topics and whatever&apos;s currently affecting us as the youth and society as a whole.</p>
        <p>As the Rise Up, we are also keen on talent promotion. Dance, spoken word,song and anything we as the youth can do to further the message of Christ. This makes it a suitable platform for anyone to display the talent they have each month. <b>ALL ARE WELCOME.</b></p>
        <p>Apart from Sundays, we also plan for other fun and engaging activities like hikes, prayer walks, dinners, sleepovers, cookouts, sports days and much more. We have a very capable team that&apos;s responsible for the planning and facilitation of all the activities we suggest and plan for.</p>
