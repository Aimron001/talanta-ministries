      Daily Vacational Bible School is, simply put, a <b>BANGER!!</b> A
      programme that your child wouldn&apos;t wanna miss for the world. From the
      intensive Bible explication to the dance, hype and games. Not to mention
      the world -famous art and craft and the multifarious yet so generic and
      potent music that deepens the kids fervor to praise and worship Him,
      <b>THIS IS THE PLACE TO BE!</b>

    <h3>Arrival</h3>
    <p>
      In the morning the kids are dropped off by bus, their parents or any other
      means fit to the venue.
    </p>
    <h3>Hype Session</h3>
    <p>
      What follows is a 15-20 min hype session outside with the kids to get them
      warmed up. After that, they march into the sanctuary ready for drills and
      pledges with Pst. Mtoto.
    </p>
    <h3>Drills and Pledges</h3>
    <p>
      The Bible and Christian flag. These are what we use to conduct the
      pledges.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#">Bible Pledge</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Christian Flag Pledge</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This is also accompanied by the singing of a song after each respective
      pledge.
    </p>
    <li>
      <a href="#">I love the bible Stand up, stand up for Jesus </a> OR
      <a href="#">OR I may never march in the infantry</a>
    </li>

    <h3>Praise and Worship and Dance</h3>
    <p>
      The children choir takes over and teaches the kids new songs and also
      sings common ones so as to create familiarity with them.
    </p>
    <p>The songs are always in the same vein to the day&apos;s theme.</p>
    <p>
      The tremendous participation displayed by the kids in these sessions is
      simply priceless. The goal, to teach the children and lead them to worship
      the Lord in truth and in spirit.
    </p>
    <p>This is so beautiful and that is why we value these times.</p>
    <img src="#" />
    <h3>className Time!</h3>
    <p>
      After having a release prayer, the kids scurry to their respective classNamees
      for the day&apos;s lesson based off the day&apos;s theme.
    </p>
    <h4>Teachers and Helpers</h4>
    <p>
      Our teaching staff from various churches is extremely dedicated to
      drilling into the kids God&apos;s Word and ensuring that Christ is their firm
      foundation and the centre of it all.
    </p>
    <img src="#" />

    <p>
      The teachers, helpers and the plethora of volunteers are trained by the
      best in the industry. We as a church understand that what is ingrained
      into the lives of these young lads and toddlers at this tender age is
      bound to stick with them forever. Therefore, why not have only the correct
      ideologies inculcated into every fibre of their very being by people
      devoted to doing so. That is our creed.
    </p>
    <img src="#" />

    <p>
      The trustee helpers are always present in className with the teachers to help
      alleviate any ruckus or commotion that may present itself during content
      delivery. They too are the one responsible for facilitation of the snacks
      per className and are present during game time.
    </p>
    <img src="#" />

    <h3>Games</h3>
    <p>Yay!</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Game time. From soccer, skipping rope, “kati”, sack racing, tag, tug of
      war, tire plays, rubber-in-and-out jumping and many other childhood
      classNameics, this is the time to showcase dominance and skill in what they
      like.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <img src="#" />

    <p></p>
    <p>
      In case of any injuries, we have a very able and alert first aid team on
      standby which is well-equipped and, the safety of the children is their
      primary concern.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Snack Time!!</h3>
    <img src="#" />

    <p>
      Games are normally draining and with energy levels in kids being at an all
      time high, they need to be juiced up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      A warm cup of cocoa and a nice fluffy cake is given to every child. All
      this, on a daily basis, ensuring that they stay psyched up and
      reinvigorated ready for the activities to come.
    </p>
    <h3>Art and Craft</h3>
    <p>
      After a brief recap of the lesson workbook manuals are issued to the older
      kids and to the younger ones, their colourings. There&apos;s always something
      for everyone.
    </p>
    <img src="#" />

    <h3>Back to the Sanctuary</h3>
    <img src="#" />

    <p>
      The kids are taken through a brief session of song and dance by the DVBS
      choir. A fun, action-packed jam session.
    </p>
    <img src="#" />

    <p>
      Now, it&apos;s time for recitations, memory work if you would. On day one each
      child is given a portion of scripture due for recitation on the days
      following in order to qualify as contenders for a mystery gift on Friday.
      The earlier the recitation&apos;s done, the bigger the present.
    </p>
    <img src="#" />

    <p>
      Simbaaaaaa!! The kids call out as they wait for the King of the Jungle to
      show up with his entourage.
    </p>
    <img src="#" />

    <p>Simba, Mutuku, Kaleche, Princess, Ahmed, Twiga and Monkey.</p>
    <img src="#" />

    <p>
      It&apos;s now time for a general recapand demo of the day&apos;s teaching by Simba
      and crew. They always have something in store for us. Clear and concise,
      the demo deepens further the teaching to the kids and with Twiga, Simba
      and Monkey making their way from the “wild” just to be with the kids, it
      all the more plausible.
    </p>
    <img src="#" />

    <h3>Prayer Sessions</h3>
    <p>
      On the very last day ministers from most if not all of the churches whose
      kids are in attendance come and give short words of enlightenment to the
      youngins and further emphasize the importance of what&apos;s been taught to
      them that week.
    </p>
    <img src="#" />

    <p>
      A few orations and it is time to commit and commission the children to go
      and implement what they&apos;ve been entrusted with. To let their light shine
      as it says in Matthew 5:14(You are the light of the world. A city that is
      set on a hill cannot be hidden.)
    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="parents" className="dvbs-parents-tab tab-content">
    <h2 id="tab-parents">DVBS PARENTS</h2>
    <p>
      After having the entire week dedicated to the kids, after all that fun,
      it&apos;s only fair that we give their parents a similar experience as well.
      Or, something close to it.
    </p>
    <p>Therefore, over the weekend, we host the parents over for their DVBS.</p>
    <img src="#" />

    <p>
      Same theme, same message, similar songs and even the age groups. Yep!
      That&apos;s right, each parent chooses the age group that they wanna belong to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parents arrive mid-morning and are taken through the same regimen as their
      kids that week. From the drills, to the hype and even puppetry.
    </p>
    <img src="#" />

    <p>
      Theirs however is a more compact and sophisticated mega lesson delivered
      to them by a number of various speakers.
    </p>
    <img src="#" />

    <p>
      They are apprised on how to further infuse and build upon what their kids
      have been taught as they are inevitably the ones who spend most time with
      them.
    </p>
    <h4>Parents, you cannot afford to miss this!</h4>
    <p>
      Proverbs 22:6 ~ Train up a child in the ways he should go; even when he is
      old, he will not depart from it.(ESV)

      The massive success and result obtained could never be possible without
      the participation of ALL the church&apos;s ministries and partners as well.
    </p>
    <p>However, big big shoutout to these ministries especially:</p>
    <section className="ushering-hospitality">
      <h3>Ushering and hospitality</h3>
      <p>These are simply put, the most devout amongst the whole lot.</p>
      <p>
        From their early arrivals, clocking in as early as 6:00AM to their
        outlandishly surreal coordination in preparation of the meals, drinks
        and assortment of the goodies, these guys work cannot go unnoticed
      </p>
      <img src="#" />

      <p>
        Their dedication and levels of impeccability are unparralled.
        <b>BIG UPS!</b>

      <h3>Transport and Security</h3>
      <p>
        Is my child safe? How will my child get back home? How will they get
        there?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>DO NOT FRET!</strong>These are the only questions lingering in
        the minds of these men. Responsible for the transportation of your child
        to and fro the venue, safety is their number one priority. (Pics)
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, while here at the venue, heh! No one with any malevolent or ill
        intentions is getting past these guys. After all your child&apos;s safety is
        the only reason they&apos;re here to begin with. (Pics)

      <p>
        Clean sanctuary, even cleaner restrooms and water for handwashing, they
        got it all covered. We take the well-being of all the children upon our
        shoulders and this is why our team of qualified doctors, first raiders
        and clean up crew are so fixated on the same. “...” … (Head of team and
